Hey there, toons!
</p>
<br>
<p>
First things first, we’d like to announce the final tally of the charity event! Thanks to the spectacular toons who spent a good chunk of time constantly busting up cogs, a total of $1883.21 USD has been raised for charity! We once again would like to give an applause to everyone who has played a part in raising money for an amazing cause.

We have tons of future content planned, and lots in store for the next few blog posts! We have been finalizing the last few details and working out the tweaks of the 1.3 update, and we can finally confirm it is right around the corner. Tons of time and effort has been put into this update for the past few weeks, and we absolutely can’t wait for you to give it a shot. To add to that, the Acorn Acres Part 2 taskline will be coming soon! Acorn Acres Part 2 will send you back to Acorn Acres after you have completed The Brrrgh. You will wander into Bossbot HQ and run through several Cog Golf Courses, and eventually take on the treacherous CEO itself. Be sure to level up your gags as soon as possible to prepare for this menacing boss!

Speaking of upcoming events, get ready to celebrate! It’s December, and December means it’s nearly Christmas time, of course. I heard there was snow heading towards town, so button up and grab your hats and gloves! Not only will Christmas be coming, though. December 20th will mark Altis’ one year anniversary! This year has certainly been a long ride, and we are proud of how far we’ve come, but we certainly can’t say that without giving YOU a thank you for sticking with us through the thick and thin and being there for Altis no matter what.
